# UFO Sightings Project Analysis
A User Guide for the UFO Sitings filtered table
---------

## The Truth is Out There
This webpage lists UFO sitings, providing the date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and additional comments on each siting.

What is exciting is the filter functionality of the table at the bottom of the page! Let's explore that next. 

## User Guide:
Let's say a site user wants more information on a UFO siting in California. 
- First, that user should scroll to the bottom of the page to locate the Filter Search.
- Next, enter the the state symbol (ca) into the State search field. **NOTE: use lowercase letters when using this search**
- Hit "Enter" on the keyboard, or click anywhere on the page.

Check the table! It has updated, filtering its data to list only sitings in California.
It's unfortunate that there are so may results, it would take some time to go through each listing. Luckily, the user remembers the UFO was shaped like an oval.
- Keep the state entry (ca) where it is.
- Then, enter the shape (oval) into the Shape search field.

Check again! There are only 2 listings! 
Now, the user can read the comments and quickly find the UFO siting they were looking for.

Oops. Were one of the filters mispelled? Was an uppercase letter used? Not to worry!
- Go back to the incorrect entry, clear it, and re-enter the desired filter.

## Drawbacks & Suggestions:
Items for future consideration include:
- Consider a site user may be unaware data is limited to 2010, or that "oval" and "circle" are categorized separately. Next time, let's add some helpful hints to our search, perhaps in the form of a pop-up or higlighted "how-to" paragraph text on the webpage. 
- With a few modificatioins, we can enable the table to allow capitalization of search terms.
- We currently do not feature filters by duration. That can be quickly addressed, once we standardize the units of time label.
- Any number of additional parameters from our dataset can be applied.
